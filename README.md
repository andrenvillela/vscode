Well, I am first of all not a professional programmer (started learning python on Jan-2019!), I am a trader that learned programming so do not expect pythonic code for now... SORRY !!!

I added 1 file for backtest, witch is very easy to modify and test new parameters so you can backtest it. You just need to work on original OHLC to add the indicators you want or any requirement that will fit into backtest.py.

I code for my need that means I did not including check for misuse of user so you most enter exactly what program request otherwise will not work.

This code is free and any help for other interested to improve the code and add new features are Very Welcome !


All the best, Andre
